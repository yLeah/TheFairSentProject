                    <h2>Project Details</h2>
                    <p>The objective of the FairSent project is to leverage AI to identify gaps in equity within criminal justice legislation and reduce bias in the allocation of sentences. Through an analysis of court cases in my community Boston, I noticed harsher sentences were allocated to areas of higher unhoused and marginalized populations. While grassroot organizations are temporary tools to address these injustices, legislation itself must be altered to address the root cause. FairSent AI pinpoints the areas in which Congressional legislation may be causing unintentional harm in order to reform our nation to better serve the people, including those who do not have the power to advocate for themselves.</p>

                    <h2>The Main Issue</h2>
                    <p>I am currently developing a model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Semantic Analysis that works to identify unjust sentences by comparing geographical locations and charges. I am also gathering the court documents I plan to use for my data analysis in a database. The model is not yet ready to be classified as a minimum viable product so the project is more conceptual currently. Through the Congressional Hackathon, I hope to obtain connections to members of Congress or my state to discuss how the tool can be enhanced to fit their needs rather than simply serving as a research/ data assessment facilitator.

                    <h2>FairSent's Impact</h2>
                    <p>Data will be pre-assessed via semantic analysis and converted to visual models and summaries that can be easily accessed by anyone including members of Congress or those who want to draw attention from Congress, looking to address specific problems within legislation. 
                        FairSent is the peopleâ€™s bridge to just legislation as it saves time on both ends, providing empirics and a platform for improvement from a given starting point. With this tool legislation can become more accurate in reflecting the values of our nation, aiding Congress to fulfilling its duty as a voice for the people. 
                        Together, we all have the ability to create a solution, which starts with identifying the problem.
